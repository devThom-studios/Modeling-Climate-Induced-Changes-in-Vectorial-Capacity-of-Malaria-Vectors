The paper discusses enhancing malaria control in Ghana by modeling climate impacts on malaria vectors (Anopheles mosquitoes). It addresses Ghana's challenges in malaria surveillance, particularly the lack of rural data and climate integration. The study uses climate data to predict mosquito survival, distribution, and transmission potential, aiding targeted malaria control. It analyzes temperature and rainfall effects on mosquito breeding and survival, using Vectorial Capacity (VC) to gauge transmission rates. Data includes rainfall from CHIRPs, temperature from ECMWF's ERA5, and future climate scenarios from CORDEX. Results show variations in malaria risk, guiding targeted control strategies. The study's approach helps adapt malaria efforts to changing transmission patterns, supporting effective interventions in Ghana.

1. **Vector Survival Rates**: Survival rates vary significantly across regions and months, with the highest rates in July, August, and September, peaking at 0.94 nationwide.
2. **Parasite Development Duration**: The time required for parasite development within mosquitoes ranges from 5 to 12 days, depending on the region and month, with August showing the longest duration.
3. **Malaria Transmission Duration**: In the current climate period, the southern regions of Ghana experience year-round transmission, while the northern region sees a shorter transmission period.
4. **Mosquito Densities and Infectious Bite Rates**: The study provides detailed assessments of mosquito densities and the average number of infectious bites per month, highlighting October as the month with the highest number of infectious bites.

These results show variations in malaria risk, guiding targeted control strategies. The study's approach helps adapt malaria efforts to changing transmission patterns, supporting effective interventions in Ghana.
